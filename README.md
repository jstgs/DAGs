# Automated Response Scripts with Apache Airflow

Welcome to the **Automated Response Scripts** repository! This collection contains a series of Apache Airflow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) designed by me to automate various security reponses

## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository features a set of Airflow DAGs created to automate a variety of tasks, allowing seamless execution of scheduled workflows. The focus is on automating response scripts, which can be easily extended for any task that requires automated responses to security events such as IP address blocking, Host isolation and more.

### Key Features:
- **Apache Airflow DAGs** for workflow orchestration.
- Task automation for sending responses and processing data.
